PCU (Perception computer unit) Dev Board v1.0, designed by AutoCore under 96Boards open standard, is a development board for automotive applications as high-performance domain controller designed by AutoCore. PCU board integrates a lock-step MCU and an high performance MPU with it. Based on the MCU-MPU architecture, different ADAS / AD or relevant functions can be integrated with different functional safety levels up to ASIL D after ISO 26262. A wide variety of interfaces are provided to support vehicle networks connection, sensors and peripherals. Additional hardware accelerator could be connected via PCIe with additional computing power.

## Applications
PCU board follows 96Boards open standard, and it is compatible with Autoware open-source autonomous driving software. It could be used in several different ways in AD/ADAS application scenarios:

1. **Single board application:**   
    - Central ECU for L2/L3 ADAS functions.
    - Drive-by-wire safe controller of autonomous driving vehicle.
    - Object detection and fusion based on LiDAR and radar.
    - High resolution localization module.
    - HD map construction.

2. **Double board application:**
    - Full redundancy system.
    - L4 AD perception, localization, planning and control.  

3. **Multi board application:**    
    - Full L4 AD functions. (with extra ADCU)
    - Work together with other hardware platform or IPC.
